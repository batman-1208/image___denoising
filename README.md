# image_denoising
# Requirments for the project:
  Python 3.7   
  opencv   
  cuda 10.0

  The DCE model does not need any special envirnment to be built  

  for running the code I extracted zip file of the provided dataset on my jupyter notebook and further provided address to the folder of images

  the code for buiding and training model is attached on my repositery , i trained my model on 200 epochs the result image obtained are attached below

  the result values obtained are:  
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) =  134.74807123015873   
 Mean Squared Error (MSE) =  98.07105287698414  
 Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) =  28.240325581938663 db
